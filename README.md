Thermocouples are very sensitive, requiring a good amplifier with a cold-compensation reference. The MAX31855K does everything for you, and can be easily interfaced with any microcontroller, even one without an analog input. This breakout board has the chip itself, a 3.3V regulator with 10uF bypass capacitors and level shifting circuitry, all assembled and tested. Comes with a 2 pin terminal block (for connecting to the thermocouple) and pin header (to plug into any breadboard or perfboard). [Goes great with our 1m K-type thermocouple](http://www.adafruit.com/products/270).

[If you need a thermocouple interface that can handle other types of thermocouples, check out our 'Universal' MAX31856 amplifier board which can be configured in the Arduino sketch to interface with just about any kind of thermocouple](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3263)
